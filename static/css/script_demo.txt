HI everyone, thanks for coming out to see HB's demo night. 

My name is Olivia

&& I chose HB because I wanted to pivot from work in molecular biology research

&& get my hands on some faster-moving projects.

My interest in the complexity of meta populations led me to work at a biotech startup
doing research on the populations of soil microbiomes.

Now, I'm excited to be working with a dataset involving honeybees.

Honeybees are, as you know, a critical part of agriculture.

However, their population sizes are dwindling due to a host of complex factors
including 
    parasites or pathogens,
    loss of habitat
    loss of biodiversity

** A COMPLEX PROBLEM **


When I found this dataset on Kaggle my idea was to create an app that could use
machine learning to categorize honeybees health.

It would be a powerful tool that could help any person contribute to our 
knowledge about 




Today I'm excited to show you my app, "The Bee Machine"

The bee machine uses the Kaggle Honeybee dataset as a LEARNING database

Using an image processing and machine learning API called Clarafai,

I have built A MODEL THAT CAN RECOGNIZE HONEYBEE HEALTH.




Learning how to use the API was the most exciting part.

Most of my work has been done on the  backend,

But i'd love to quickly introcude the technologies that made the app possible


The dataset is from Kaggle


The Database uses SQLAlchemy, with a simple model:

    class USER represents the users of the app

    class BEE represents a bee image, including metadata.

    They have a one-to-many relationship, since Users can upload multiple bees.



My backend was implemented in PYTHON using some statistical libraries including 
NUMPY.

I interacted with the Clarafai API and 

Frontend with JQuery




*** Each time the user uploads a photo, they are IMPROVING the MACHINE LEARNING MODEL. ***










Thanks and if you want to chat about machine learning, find me afterwards!
