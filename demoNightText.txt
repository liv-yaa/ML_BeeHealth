Hi! My name is Olivia.

Welcome to my app, "The Bee Machine"

I'm going to jump right in and show you the user interface. 

It's deceptively simple, because once I upload a photo, that's when the real
action takes off.

I used to be a molecular biology reseracher at a biotech startup.

I decided to attend Hackbright because I'm passionate about making slow things 
Faster and more scalable,
especially when working with large, convoluted datasets.

The first time I ever used Python was to automate experiments involving
gene expression analysis.

I've been hooked since. For a year I took classes in Java and Object
Oriented programming, and now I'm at Hackbright picking up the skills to make
a fullstack web app. 

It implements Python, Flask, Jinja, Javascript, Jquery, 
and SQLAlchemy to create the backend.



One great place to practice working with datasets is a site named Kaggle,
which I first explored when I was studying bioinformatics.



When I saw the Annotated Honeybee image database, I was excited to find that 
there were ACTUAL data scientists who managed to predict the Bee health by 
using machine learning on the images.

It's the sort of massive dataset too large for a human to manually classify,
so it made sense to try machine learning in my own implementation.

The images needed to go through a fair amount of pre-processing,
so I decided to use a machine learning API called Clarafai.

Bit by bit, I wrote a module that interacted wtih the API, providing a layer of
abstraction for interacting with it.



use Clarafai is able to use a set of photos to create a machine learning model,
and once the model is built, it can be used to predict concepts on images you upload.

It also automatically bins the images into training, testing, and prediction sets.
