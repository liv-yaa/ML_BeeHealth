## Project title
"The Bee Machine" 

## Motivation
Honeybee populations are dwindling and you can help! Submit a photo of a bee to our machine learning model and you can contribute to a database that tracks honeybee health trends. One photo at a time, we can help save the bees.

## Tech and frameworks used:

Python
Flask
Jinja
CSS
HTML
SQLAlchemy
PostgreSQL Database

## How to use?
Upload a photo. Specify "healthy" for healthy bees. All other enties will be tagged "unhealthy".

## Contribute
You can contribute to The Bee Machine by uploading a bee photo. The more photos are submitted, the more powerful the health sorting algorithm will become. General guidelines for photo submissions would be to make sure the image is quality and it is a bee. Otherwise, the model should screen for any non-bee images too.
